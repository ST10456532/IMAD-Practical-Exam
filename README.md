Purpose of the app is to create a weather App that will show the average temperature experienced for the week for my team of developers.

 I created a user Interface that has the name of my app which is The Weather Report .The interface also contains a weather icon which emphasizes more that this app is strictly about weather .
 it contains two buttons one button is called ExitApp which allows you to the exit the app . The other button is called Main Screen which will take you straight to the Main Screen .

 main screen contains the already calculated average temperature for the week . I forgot to mention the information or data that allowed me to calculate the average was stored in 4 parallel arrays . Whats not shown is how its calculated i added the minimum and maximum temperature for each day and divided it by 2 to the daily average temperature .With all the daily Average Temperatures i got  i added them all together and divided them by seven to get the weeks average temperature. An The app itself is supposed to show a weeks detailed weather report .
